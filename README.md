Thoughts about professional programming

# Intro

> What's the difference between professional and amateur coders?

It is **not** ttechnical skill. There are many coders out there doing great work without being professionals. They just love it and do it for fun, which is great and most appreciated. You *are* a professional coder as soon as you start earning money with it. Period. Deal with it.

> So professional programming is not fun?

No no! This would be horrible. Programming should always be fun! But earning money with software is just a different thing.

> I don't understand. What's different when i start earning money with it?

You must return a value. If you spend money on something, you want something in return. It is just that simple. You would not buy anything which does not represent any kind of value to you, wouldn't you?

> That's too abstract to me. What does "value" mean in terms of software?

This strongly depends on the marketing department ;-)

Companies often want to automate a process to save time ( money ), reduce errors or monitor the huge amounts of data emitted in production. They do not invest money for fun, but to increase their own income and/or reduce expenses.

> Sounds easy to me, what's the point?

There are more aspects of "value" to be considered. An amateur coder can produce a piece of software that satisfies the compnay goals mentioned earlier. But does it scale with a growing company? Will other coders be able to maintain this piece of software? How stable does it actually work? Is it easy to learn for new users? Just to mention a few non-functional aspects. Many of these questions must be asked as soon as a piece of software is sold.

And the one million dollar question has not been asked yet: How much does it cost?

> Well, i would estimate the price by the time it takes me to write it.

Good approach, but do you know how long it will take you *before* you start? Are you 100% sure the software ordered can be finished in a limited time?

It just takes more than technical skill to earn money with software.

> But what else do i need then?

Methods. Methods make you a professional. You are able to organize your work into manageable pieces. You can use methods to plan your work and communicate about it with other coders and ( ! ) users of your software. By organizing you are able to estimate more and more precisely in order to calculate the value created by your software.
